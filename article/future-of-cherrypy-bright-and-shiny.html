        Future of CherryPy: bright and&nbsp;shiny?
      </a>
    </h2>

    <p>First off, I really hope so, tough at the same time I see the reasons for it. Moreover
I have been trying to contribute back to the community by giving knowledge that could hopefully
cut the rough edges that I’ve met on my way of learning and employing CherryPy <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id32" id="id1">[1]</a>. And when
CherryPy is calling, I have something to&nbsp;say.</p>
<p>This article is my consideration in reply to the holiday post <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id33" id="id2">[2]</a> by Sylvain Hellegouarch
in CherryPy user group about its current state and future, which recalls to older big
discussion <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id34" id="id3">[3]</a> about the status of development of&nbsp;CherryPy.</p>

<div class="section" id="acquisition">
<h2>Acquisition</h2>
<p>My CherryPy experience started in beginning of 2011. I had a chance to jump ship to Python
web application development and I didn’t lose it. At that moment I had years of web development
experience, so I was looking for the certain piece of software. If I would start this search
today, most of the front page titles are the same. The same <em>you don&#8217;t have to be the best to
be popular</em> still applies to the very domain of Python&nbsp;application.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent a couple of weeks reading the web: reviews, comparisons, benchmarks <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id35" id="id4">[4]</a> and
StackOverflow <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id36" id="id5">[5]</a>. And I have to admit that there are paths for newcomers to CherryPy,
who look for stable, fast, well-designed and pythonic <span class="caps">HTTP</span> framework with its own Zen <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id37" id="id6">[6]</a>
(like Python itself <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id38" id="id7">[7]</a>), that doesn&#8217;t dictate application design, nor what tools to use,
but rather provides structure, testability and primitives that help code&nbsp;scale.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scope">
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>Where CherryPy stands? I think it perfectly stands as a Python <span class="caps">HTTP</span> application server. It
allows a developer to write a genuine Python code, use the best from the Cheese Shop,
design applications in whatever desired way (but with restrictions of threaded execution&nbsp;model).</p>
<div class="section" id="self-contained-packages">
<h3>Self-contained&nbsp;packages</h3>
<p>I agree that stable pure-Python <span class="caps">HTTP</span> server is one of major features of CherryPy. Because
basically, in most cases one can just forget about <span class="caps">WSGI</span>, and use good old <span class="caps">HTTP</span> — bare CherryPy or
behind reverse-proxy like nginx. Less intermediaries means less problems as it simplifies
development and deployment. However, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an additive feature. If you extract the
web-server into a stand-alone package, be it named Cheroot or something else, it won&#8217;t be as
valuable for application development. If there are other frameworks&#8217; users who host their <span class="caps">WSGI</span>
applications with CherryPy, it&#8217;s their problem of deployment and of these framework&#8217;s authors.
This usage is ultimately a byproduct of CherryPy&#8217;s <span class="caps">WSGI</span> compliance and stability, and let it
stay&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as the questions risen in the post are mostly about the cost of CherryPy
maintenance, if the increased modularity will help to reduce it, then it surely makes sense.
But the extraction also has its cost, and if the code of target functionality is tightly coupled
with the rest of the codebase, then benefits of extraction should clearly outweigh its cost.
At least inner-package refactoring towards more encapsulated components is possible with
almost the same&nbsp;benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation-support">
<h3>Implementation&nbsp;support</h3>
<p>Regarding supported Python implementation official website says: <em>Python 2.5+, 3.1+, PyPy, Jython
and Android</em>. Documentation says: <em>CPython, IronPython, Jython and PyPy</em> and <em>CherryPy supports
Python 2.3 through to 3.4.</em>. There&#8217;s no need to say about official distribution, CPython, but its
versions are in question. There&#8217;s a lot of compatibility code for old Python versions in CherryPy,
which can be shrunk by lifting the bar closer to actual ones. I don&#8217;t think the move is for 3.x
series, but for CherryPy 4, CPython 2.7 and 3.3+ are fine. This is a real way to make the codebase
cleaner, smaller and fun to deal with&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>PyPy is constantly taking more ground and is supported by many libraries that also grow in
number. However I can&#8217;t get many real use-cases out of my head (if we don&#8217;t actually include the
case of a long task which should be run in background, but is run synchronously as an effort
tradeoff and assuming it can benefit from <span class="caps">JIT</span>), nor do I know if there&#8217;s <span class="caps">CPU</span>-bound hot CherryPy
code. Mostly I feel it&#8217;s a cool-factor, but with possible real use-cases. So I think it&#8217;s a good
idea to keep it. The problem with supporting PyPy is its garbage collectors. They aren&#8217;t based on
reference counting, thus files, sockets and everything that was able to close itself passing out
of the execution scope with zero references on CPython, won&#8217;t deterministically keep doing it on
PyPy. It makes more strict demands on code to keep it memory-leak free. Python3&#8217;s
<tt class="docutils literal">ResourceWarning</tt> can help with it. I left a bug report <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id39" id="id8">[8]</a> about the subject once when I was
porting a CherryPy-based library to&nbsp;Python3.</p>
<p>The rest is more questionable. CherryPy running on Android is clearly a cool-factor.
<span class="caps">SL4A</span> with Python isn&#8217;t straightforward to install, and even though there&#8217;s complete
CPython 2.6, it barely has a single real use-case. There&#8217;s file <span class="caps">API</span>, SQLite and the rest
important things we use server-side for, for PhoneGap and the like, for ones who write <span class="caps">HTML5</span>
application. There&#8217;s Kivy with established deployment. The same way I feel of Jython and
IronPython support. I have no idea if anyone is actually using CherryPy on them, but having them
officially supported complicates things. Testing, debugging, developing the framework. I think
these highly specific environments should be covered by enthusiasts, if there&#8217;re any out there,
who deal with them. If there&#8217;s a bug, say for Jython, it should be treated as enhancement and
fixed only if the fix doesn&#8217;t impede design, performance and maintainability of primary
implementations&#8217; code. I think guarantees and according measures are needed, so it&#8217;s clear
what is officially supported by CherryPy, and what it may run&nbsp;on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="to-depend-or-not-to">
<h3>To depend or not&nbsp;to</h3>
<p>For an application it is perfectly fine to depend on as many libraries to delegate as most
out-of-domain functionality away from its codebase. On the other hand for a library it&#8217;s not as
good idea. There&#8217;s a functional difference between a library and a framework, but for current
form of CherryPy these terms feel&nbsp;interchangeable.</p>
<p>For a library having no dependencies is a feature when general <em>less moving parts, less issues</em>
applies. It may relate to broken, abandoned, license-changed 3rd-party dependencies. It may be
incompatible changes, or used C-modules which complicate installation and use in PyPy and other
implementations and platforms. Thus as CherryPy has grown its own pure-Python internals which
are fast and stable, I think there&#8217;s no point in abandoning&nbsp;them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hype-fuss-and-choices">
<h3>Hype, fuss and&nbsp;choices</h3>
<p>Last, but not least thing I want to note about the scope of CherryPy is its technology choice.
<span class="caps">WSGI</span> is good example here. From inception it likely was a cool thing in Python. <span class="caps">WSGI</span> here
and <span class="caps">WSGI</span> there, standards, uniformity and stuff. And then, a little later&#8230; oops, a synchronous
protocol. No WebSockets, no <span class="caps">SSE</span>, no other close to real-time techniques. This choice affects, for
example things like django-sse <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id40" id="id9">[9]</a> and its users <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id41" id="id10">[10]</a> (though this community is strongest in
seeing everything as a nail). But also PaaS providers like OpenShift <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id42" id="id11">[11]</a>, and probably&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>That is to say it&#8217;s okay to be compliant (e.g. <span class="caps">WSGI</span>-compliant), but it&#8217;s not okay to be a pliable
bigot, who praises next cool X at every turn. In that sense I like how CherryPy stands. Simple is
simple in a threaded server. Real-time stuff needed? Sylvain&#8217;s ws4py <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id43" id="id12">[12]</a> to the rescue.
Simple background processing? There you go with <tt class="docutils literal">cherrypy.process.plugins.BackgroundTask</tt>.
So I want to keep seeing CherryPy making conscious and pragmatic technology&nbsp;choices.</p>
<p>2014 has seen new breed of asynchronous libraries within Python 3.4+ batteries, <tt class="docutils literal">asyncio</tt>. It
is nice to see co-operative execution in Python finds more expressive language constructs and
tooling, but apart from its niche uses I suspect it&#8217;ll be next asynchronicity-everywhere craze,
which will lead to rewrites, new cool stuff and more &#8220;pressure&#8221; on users of &#8220;old&#8221; software. At
least, there&#8217;s no evidence that it can be faster on generic load, as CherryPy is neck and neck
with Tornado <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id35" id="id13">[4]</a>. There&#8217;s good socket performance notice <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id44" id="id14">[13]</a> in Python documentation which
also applies generally to such design&nbsp;choice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s no question that the fastest sockets code uses non-blocking sockets and select to
multiplex them. You can put together something that will saturate a <span class="caps">LAN</span> connection without
putting any strain on the <span class="caps">CPU</span>. The trouble is that an app written this way can’t do much
of anything else - it needs to be ready to shuffle bytes around at all&nbsp;times.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Finally, remember that even though blocking sockets are somewhat slower than non-blocking,
in many cases they are the “right” solution. After all, if your app is driven by the data
it receives over a socket, there’s not much sense in complicating the logic just so your
app can wait on <tt class="docutils literal">select</tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal">recv</tt>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="audience">
<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>Naturally appreciation comes from the target audience. For a newbie in <span class="caps">HTTP</span> (which is a
complex protocol by the way) and application development in general, Django may be a blessed
gift because it helps to meet her goals by answering as many development questions as possible,
and at the same time for an experienced developer it may seem a worthless bulk of bloatware
that solves all its tasks equally poor (like all generic solutions, though). The same newbie
won&#8217;t be able to effectively use CherryPy because it won&#8217;t answer the several dozen of questions
for&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>If CherryPy stays CherryPy there can&#8217;t and shoundn&#8217;t be answers for many of them. How to design
my application? What application directory layout to use? What persistance layer and storage to
employ? How do I render a template in CherryPy? It&#8217;s all up to you, developer. From my
experience, reading others&#8217; opinions on the web, and particularly in the user group, there is
an unanimously opinion that CherryPy&#8217;s barrier to entry is high, but once you wrapped your head
around its concepts you&#8217;re enlightened and&nbsp;empowered.</p>
<p>These points lead to two measures of increasing CherryPy user base, and hopefully contributors at
some proportional rate. First is targeting more specific audience. Examining the main page <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id32" id="id15">[1]</a> it
is at least not bad. It shows that simple is easy, and gives clues that complex is possible. It
refers to <em>any other object-oriented Python program</em>, which indicates good <span class="caps">API</span>. But it&#8217;s biased
opinion, because I look at things in reverse. Is it really that comprehensible for one who is
making decision at the moment? Is there some real-world CherryPy code that is widely
considered worth exposing, that is done &#8220;right&#8221; way and promotes best CherryPy practices? Second
is means of lowering and alleviating barrier to entry, see <a class="reference internal" href="#improvement">Improvement</a>&nbsp;section.</p>
<p>A note about code hosting that is supposed to affect the audience. I agree with Konstantin
Molchanov, that magic pixies&#8230; wait no, the best friend of Ruby and Rails, to the backbone
awesome, the octocat won&#8217;t make CherryPy popular by the wave of its tentacle. There&#8217;s no outreach
program nor there&#8217;s traffic charity for newcomers on Github. It&#8217;s a popular code hosting which
makes it easy to contribute to a Git repository, in case there&#8217;re ones who are willing to. But
if there are no new contributors, I don&#8217;t see the way it can&nbsp;help.</p>
<p>Though it may not work in opposite direction, because if there&#8217;s a Python developer willing to
contribute to a Python project, the developer may expect a Python tool for it, which Git is not.
I think it&#8217;s a disillusioned and naive idea to turn away from Mercurial to get more Python users.
At the same time, I cannot disagree with Nic Young that there&#8217;re a few developer services (mostly
for quality assurance) which integrate only with Github, which are free for open source projects
and may be useful for CherryPy (e.g. TravisCI is not Git-only, but Github-only because it&#8217;s tied
to its <span class="caps">API</span>), albeit none of them lack&nbsp;alternatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="part-taken">
<h2>Part&nbsp;taken</h2>
<p>A year after I commenced my CherryPy affair one web application project was in production and I
possessed certain portion of experience. Specifically saying, deployment struggle experience.
Having <span class="caps">HTTP</span>-only deployment was very helpful, because I could reuse the knowledge I had, but Linux
part was at most scarce, poorly covered and I was groping for valuable pieces of knowledge all
over the web. Having mint Debian box how do I make my application continuously deployable? How do
I make it first-class daemon and run it as <em>www-data</em>? How do I put it behind nginx? How do I
monitor its memory and <span class="caps">CPU</span> usage? How to restart it if it has crashed? How do I rotate its&nbsp;logs?</p>
<p>That time I already had the answers, and they were put together and published as tutorial/skeleton
project <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id45" id="id16">[14]</a>. I felt it was necessary contribution to make. Obviously, it hasn&#8217;t received high
volume traffic, but qualitatively there&#8217;re constant visits from all over the world (and least from
the countries where people do <span class="caps">IT</span>), which indicates that CherryPy still attracts new&nbsp;users.</p>
<p>In mid-2013 I&#8217;ve written another tutorial/skeleton project <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id46" id="id17">[15]</a>, and even though its goal
is maintainable JavaScript website-like application design, its server-side is CherryPy
application with real-world template layout for Jina2 and according CherryPy tool. I&#8217;ve found
time to write documentation for it only in the end of 2014, so it is also an on topic&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2014 I started to participate on StackOverflow&#8217;s CherryPy tag <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id36" id="id18">[5]</a>. It was
another pay-off kind of thing, because the site was helpful to me, and its CherryPy part
specifically. But the latter sadly had a lot of unanswered question making it feel a little
abandoned. In fact many questions are quite interesting dealing with performance, design,
execution model of CherryPy, so it requires an answerer to have a good grasp of documentation and
codebase. Besides making other users&#8217; CherryPy experience better, it is fun and cognitive
activity. It sheds the light on how people really use CherryPy, how they start, where are
remaining rough edges and what is the room for&nbsp;improvement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improvement">
<h2>Improvement</h2>
<p>Inherently I&#8217;m an application guy. I pick out cog-wheels, tune them and make spin together. I
don&#8217;t work on a library oftentimes, nor do I have much time for it, but because I really value
CherryPy I want to have a way to do it, in case I have time and idea for improvement or fix. For
instance, I want to add privilege drop plugin to <tt class="docutils literal">cherryd</tt> and make other minor improvement to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>When you file a bug report, you generally expect someone, a core contributor or so, to tell you
whether it is generally valid or not. Then it may be re-prioritized, assigned to someone or put
on a shelf to wait its day. Without this initial input it&#8217;s a little confusing. &#8220;Okay, no one
replied. It should be working other way&#8221;, — you may think, at&nbsp;best.</p>
<p>Understanding the flow of one&#8217;s patch to CherryPy codebase is also important. Official site says
<em>fork CherryPy on BitBucket here and submit pull-request with your modifications</em>. When it&#8217;s a bug
either when it&#8217;s an enhancement? Who and where to ask a flow question, say about branching, or
about eligibility of a change. There&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="caps">CONTRIBUTING</span>.txt</tt> which didn&#8217;t appear long ago and it
points to Jason Coombs&#8217; post <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id48" id="id19">[17]</a> about writing a perfect pull request. It is at least something
but I think it can be more clear and CherryPy-specific. Also I think it should in the
documentation, linked from the website&#8217;s main&nbsp;page.</p>
<div class="section" id="quality-assurance">
<h3>Quality&nbsp;assurance</h3>
<p>I think things like bug #1298 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id47" id="id20">[16]</a> should never happen to a project which is maintained in
a responsible way and puts effort in quality assurance. Okay, I see <tt class="docutils literal">tox.ini</tt> in root of the
project. I clone it, and run <tt class="docutils literal">tox</tt>. Duh, all environments have failed. Besides, not all the
claimed environments are in the file. Moreover, it&#8217;s some kind of back in Soviet Russia story.
Why the hell unit tests ask me questions!? Are they examining me instead? More surprises?
ShiningPanda is dead <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id49" id="id21">[18]</a>, the same way as the link to it from the CherryPy website under
<em>online tests</em> section (<em>continuous integration</em> is kind of standard term for the thing, as
online tests refer more to <span class="caps">IQ</span> tests, psychology, et&nbsp;cetera).</p>
<p>To name it honestly, this is a reckless way of maintaining a project. Reckless to users whose
applications will break with next release published this way. And <em>interpretation result</em> is
as much time-consuming as to see whether the build page is green or red. No, I&#8217;m not promoting
these cool badges one can see all around. I&#8217;m talking about the responsive flow where every
contributor runs tests on all supported Python implementations (with Tox) before pushing her
changes. If one is lazy to care and to set up all implementations, but has itching fingers to
push some changes anyway, having the notification like: <em>Hey, you&#8217;ve just broken CherryPy. Please
fix <span class="caps">ASAP</span></em> would be helpful. I think for everyone who has write permission to the repository it
makes sense to receive such notification. At very least the one who publishes CherryPy to the
Cheese Shop should have rigid requirement to check <span class="caps">CI</span>&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>The same concern, with lesser strain, applies to the ReadTheDocs builds, which all have failed
for last 3 months <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id50" id="id22">[19]</a>.</p>
<p>This is the problem which needs to be solved as soon as possible. In 2014 I tried the <span class="caps">CI</span> service
called Drone.io, which supports the three major code hosing services. Well, it turned out to be
usable (build page example <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id51" id="id23">[20]</a>). I can help assist or set it up for CherryPy, once flow and
role questions are&nbsp;answered.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="barrier-to-entry">
<h3>Barrier to&nbsp;entry</h3>
<p>Hopefully, one of biggest barriers I was facing myself seems to have passed. I mean that
documentation link erosion where almost every single CherryPy-related link on the web leaded
to 404 page. I think ReadTheDocs adoption is huge improvement, especially considering that new
documentation, being clearly a better one, lacks some details that were covered in version 3.3.
Having persistent, versioned and indexable documentation is very&nbsp;helpful.</p>
<p>I think, it should be stated more or less directly that if one wants a framework to
make application design decisions it&#8217;s better off using something else, not CherryPy. Okay,
here&#8217;s Joe who knows enough about Python. He&#8217;s conscious and is willing to make application design
decisions and take responsibility for them. But he also has a deadline. Joe doesn&#8217;t expect his
first real-world CherryPy application to be shiny from experienced CherryPy developer point of
view, albeit functional from end-user&#8217;s. What&#8217;s the best way to help Joe create functional
prototype quickly, and let him gradually improve the design and codebase of his application
thereafter, along with CherryPy&nbsp;knowledge?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at CherryPy knowledge as a tree. Each branch represents a functionality. Say a CherryPy
tool branch. As it goes from the root, there&#8217;re nodes like <em>Copy-paste this decorator to turn your
handler result into <span class="caps">JSON</span></em>, <em>What other tools are capable of?</em>, <em>What is a CherryPy tool, and how
to write one?</em>, <em>Tool hook-points, types, priorities, etc.</em>. The same is for other branches —
from basic to advanced. And what will Joe benefit from the most is breadth-first traversing on the
tree. Better if some of a few first levels are illustrated with runnable snippets. This way it&#8217;s
possible to give overview, tunable blocks of code and directions for improvement. For the later is
important to spur creativity, but not enforcing design decisions, in the way: <em>start with this,
improve by yourself</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just glanced over the latest documentation over again, and surprise, it narrates in very
similar fashion! Sylvain has done a great job. But what is catching my eye is that there&#8217;s two
separate tutorial series now: one in the source code <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id52" id="id24">[21]</a>, another in the documentation <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id53" id="id25">[22]</a>.
Even though both serve the same purpose, the former is much easier to maintain, covering with
tests which leads to the bonus of better regression test suite. If the later&#8217;s textual flexibility
can be sacrificed for less maintenance cost, I think, it&#8217;s possible to generate tutorial section
from module docstrings and code, and merge the&nbsp;two.</p>
<p>However, both series deal with simplest cases and there&#8217;s a big gap between them and real-world
application requirements. Here I also a snippet to base on directly or get ideas from to
get a prototype faster, but with real-world tools. Like safe database access in threaded
environment, <span class="caps">URL</span> routing and generation, multi-allplication design and so on. Sylvain&#8217;s CherryPy
recipes <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id54" id="id26">[23]</a> referred in the documentation several times may answer this to some extent, but in
general I think it&#8217;s still in question. But also whether it should maintained in centralized
fashion within CherryPy. Or if it&#8217;s more suitable for external source, like post on somebody&#8217;s
blog or&nbsp;StackOverflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contribution-packages">
<h3>Contribution&nbsp;packages</h3>
<p>I think Eric Larson&#8217;s suggestion about <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cherrypy-*</span></tt> pageages makes sense. For example there&#8217;s
a package called cherrys <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id55" id="id27">[24]</a> which is the good example. It&#8217;s a Redis adapter for
CherryPy session handling. What&#8217;s important it has clearly defined scope and doesn&#8217;t affect
an application design. This way it might have been named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cherrypy-redis-session</span></tt>.</p>
<p>A package that is an implementaion of an CherryPy interface must be appropriate for packaging and
sharing. Sharing a CherryPy application with clearly defined scope, like Dowser <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id56" id="id28">[25]</a>, is
also&nbsp;beneficial.</p>
<p>On the contrary specific tools or plugins that affect application design shouldn&#8217;t be packaged.
For instance, looking at Sylvain&#8217;s recipes they are all better to say recipes. Let&#8217;s look
at Jinja2 recipe <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id57" id="id29">[26]</a>. Besides having a class per file isn&#8217;t pythonic, and splitting a thing
into plugin and tool isn&#8217;t always rewarding, it makes certian assumtion on how template file
names are defined for the <span class="caps">URL</span>. Jina2 is a flexible template engine with notion of template
inheritance. Real-world projects have dozens of templates and tend to orgianize them by role
and use. Having some convention-over-configuration rule for template name is very handy.
So I want to say it&#8217;s usually better to have a small and effiective application-specific
CherryPy tool or plugin rather than trying to invent something overly broad and generic&nbsp;one.</p>

<div class="section" id="other-changes">
<h3>Other&nbsp;changes</h3>
<p>Bitbucket pages should have either actual supplementing information or no supplementing
information. Menu community link <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id58" id="id30">[27]</a> leads to wiki home page where version section has latest
version of 3.2.5. Menu development link <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id59" id="id31">[28]</a>, which points to the repository overview page refers
to Python 2.3, where the site&#8217;s version starts with 2.5+. Referring <tt class="docutils literal">python setup.py install</tt> as
installation command, which requires a manual download, ought to be changed to normal
<tt class="docutils literal">pip install cherrypy</tt>.</p>
<p>I think, minor changes on the website are&nbsp;needed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>no need in download link in the&nbsp;menu,</li>
<li>add <em>install</em> section after <em>features</em> which says <tt class="docutils literal">pip install cherrypy</tt>,</li>
<li>community link is better to refer to the user&nbsp;group,</li>
<li>rename <em>online tests</em>, change the service link, use better sentence which will emphasize&nbsp;reliability.</li>
</ul>
<p>About <tt class="docutils literal">_cp</tt> module prefix. There&#8217;re some public classes like <tt class="docutils literal">cherrypy._cptools.HandlerTool</tt>,
which may be used in user code directly or as super classes. This isn&#8217;t correct naming, according
to the underscore convention. So it&#8217;s a good idea to change it some day. Though as a PyDev user I
can&#8217;t recall to any issues with&nbsp;it.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p>I can conclude that there&#8217;re two things that I&#8217;m seeing problematic: quality assurance for various
claimed enviroments CherryPy to support and lack of contribution guiadance, specifically in the
form of bug tracker supervisor. The rest feels normal, if that makes sense and as it is usually
the case needs small constant improment and&nbsp;polishing.</p>
